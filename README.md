Issue tracker - SpaceCP Open Beta
===========================================

Hello and welcome! Thank you for participating in SpaceCP's open beta. You're awesome!  
To keep things nice and clear, please follow these simple guidelines:

#### How do I report bugs?

1. Grab yourself a github account. 
2. Head over to the [Issues](https://github.com/SpaceCP/Bugs/issues) tab
3. **Make sure your problem has NOT been reported yet**
4. Either create a new issue, or contribute to the **already existing** thread. 

#### What should I write?

The more information, the better. Browser, the OS you're using to access the panel, 
the OS you're using to run the daemon, specific steps to reproduce an issue, etc. etc...  
Basically: try to help as much as you can in identifying and fixing the problem.

#### I'm awesome? 

Yes. Very. Keep at it! Enjoy SpaceCP!
