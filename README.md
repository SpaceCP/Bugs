Issue tracker - SpaceCP Open Beta
===========================================

Hello and welcome! Thank you for participating in SpaceCP's open beta. You're awesome for doing so!  
To keep things nice and clear, please follow these simple guidelines:

#### How do I report bugs?

1. Register for a github account or login to yours. 
2. Head over to the [Issues](https://github.com/SpaceCP/Bugs/issues) tab
3. **Make sure your problem has NOT been reported yet**
4. Either create a new issue, or contribute to the thread **already existing for the issue**. 

#### What should I include in my report?

One bug per issue please! Don't create lists of bugs in one issue.  
The more information, the better. Basically: try to help as much as you can in identifying and fixing the problem.  
We're specifically looking for the following information:

- **Specific steps to reproduce the issue**
- Browser
- Operating system of your daemon
- What game and mod the issue occurred on
- What area of the panel the issue occurred on
- Was there any code or error displayed? (F12 in chrome and click on the red X's on the near-bottom right if its there and include those errors)

#### Am I awesome? 

Yes, very. Keep at it! Enjoy SpaceCP!
