Issue tracker - SpaceCP Open Beta
===========================================

Hello and welcome! Thank you for participating in SpaceCP's open beta. You're awesome!  
To keep things nice and clear, please follow these simple guidelines:

#### How do I report bugs?

1. Grab yourself a github account. 
2. Head over to the [Issues](https://github.com/SpaceCP/Bugs/issues) tab
3. **Make sure your problem has NOT been reported yet**
4. Either create a new issue, or contribute to the thread **already existing for the issue**. 

#### What should I write?

Write one Github Issue per bug, don't create lists of bugs in one Issue.  
The more information, the better. Basically: try to help as much as you can in identifying and fixing the problem.  
We're specifically looking for the following information:

- **Specific steps to reproduce the issue**
- Browser
- Operating system of your daemon
- What game and mod the issue occurred on
- What area of the panel the issue occurred on
- Was there any code or error displayed?

#### I'm awesome? 

Yes. Very. Keep at it! Enjoy SpaceCP!
